# LINUX FUNDAMENTALS
## Introduction
### 1. *Linux-Structure*

#### i. Philosophy
* Everything is a file
* Small, single-purpose programs
* Ability to chain programs together to perform complex tasks
* Avoid captive user interfaces
* Configuration data stored in a text file

#### ii. Components
* **Bootloader**  - Program used to guide the booting processes to start the OS e.g GRUB
* **OS Kernel** - Core component of the OS that controls resources for the I/O devices or hardware of the computer
* **Daemons** - Background processes e.g Systemd
* **OS Shell** - Command Language interpreter that provides users with an interface to control/interact with the OS
* **Graphics Server** - Provides X-Server that allows graphical apps to run either locally or remotely
* **Window Manager** - Also known as GUI e.g GNOME, KDE
* **Utilities/Applications** - programs that perform particular functions for the user or another program.

 #### iii. Linux Architecture
 * *Hardware*
 * *Kernel*
 * *Shell*
